His IT career began in 1999 when he first moved to the United States from Canada after being recruited by an international consulting firm.

His current employer, B&R Business Solutions, is a New Jersey based consulting company with a deep focus on SharePoint. Dan's specialty is custom development, but he has been seen working in many other areas, including product development, architecture, project management and business analysis to name a few.

When not sitting in front of his many monitors in his home office, coding away like a madman, he enjoys spending time with his exceptionally awesome and beautiful daughter Lily and gallivanting around the globe (mostly just back to Canada) to visit and spend time with his stunning fianc Gillian.

You can find Dan moderating or speaking at the monthly meeting of the Atlanta SharePoint User Group (@atlspug, #atlspug), online via Twitter (@jdattis), LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/in/jakedanattis/), at a SharePoint Conference or SharePoint Saturday, or on Skype (jdattis).
