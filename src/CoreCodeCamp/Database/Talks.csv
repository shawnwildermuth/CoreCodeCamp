2551,Dynamics CRM as a Development Platform,"When many people hear of Dynamics CRM, a static, rigid application focused around a very specific use case comes to mind. Over the years, Dynamics CRM has morphed quite a bit, turning itself from CRM to xRM. <br/>Dynamics is highly configurable and just about any data entry application can be built with it, but it's much more. It is meant to be extended with .NET, WCF, Workflow Foundation, Silverlight (and ASP.NET) and Javascript. You can model entities in minutes instead of hours or days and you can build fully functional forms in minutes. But used as a platform, it gives you much more. Without writing a single line of code you have a security model so granular, you can restrict and grant access down to the attribute level. You have an out of the box Workflow engine complete with a fairly powerful UI Based Workflow Designer. Forms can be build and modified by anyone that can drag and drop controls. There is a rich reporting infrastructure based on SSRS complete with a designer that lets you build sophisticated reports with ease. These reports can be easily incorporated into very impressive customized dashboards that provide a 360 degree view of an organization, tailored to individuals, groups, teams, business units or the organization as a whole.<br/>If you know .NET and Javascript, learning the API is very simple matter and coupled with the existing toolset CRM provides out of the box, CRM makes a superb platform for a very wide variety of projects",None,100,2013,,,3:50pm,,1657,3117,IT Topics,,https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/ATLCC20131085,,,1/1/1900 0:00,

This presentation will highlight some of the classic pitfalls of large C++ projects and show how proper attention to design will result in code that is reliable and easy to maintain.  Find out how to apply object models and even discover ways to measure reusability.<br/><br/><br/><br/>By way of example we will look at the internal Class structure of several Open Source applications, identifying unused and overused classes, exploring similar classes (which perhaps could be combined into a single class) and learning how to mine open source software for reusable gems that can be incorporated into your development.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Any large project, over time, will evolve sections of code that are unused yet are still maintained because they have not been identified.  These classes must be found early if development is to be streamlined, but it is also important to know about classes that are overused and perhaps incorporate too much functionality, making them difficult to maintain and test.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Developers must understand these principles in order to create stable and reusable software, and managers need to understand them in order to keep their projects on track.<br/><br/>",,300,2014,,,1:30pm,,2054,4529,Developers,,,,,1/1/1900 0:00,

The solution's processing can be readily configured (threads, concurrent queue items, etc.).  A generic Dispatcher exists that executes target specific tasks (generate emails, edit PDFs to add header info, update indexes, other requirements).  The solution can spin Pipelines for these different tasks. The solution fits into the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) realm per interacting against different interfaces, taking task requests, and executing tasks. One could also link operations together (a task requests another task to do work).  New tasks can be defined and just need to be registered at run time.  A task can be anything but generally are singular - i.e. do a specific work item (send email acknowledgement, update a set of data, etc.).  For error management, if error in pipeline then queued task that failed goes to dead letter queue along with logs for review and resubmission where applicable.",,100,2014,,,11:20am,,2069,4547,General Discussion,,,,,1/1/1900 0:00,

4352,Introduction to Clojure,"Clojure is a functional programming language, built for concurrency, that can be compiled to Java bytecode, JavaScript or the .NET IL. Clojure's emphasis on simplicity and using a REPL for a tight feedback loop make it ideal for exploring a problem and iterating quickly to a solution. It is terse and expressive, so problems can be solved with less code.  It's ability to interoperate with various host platforms means that your program will be able to use your existing libraries, or be used as a library from your existing programs. This talk will introduce the basics of Clojure, and with most of the examples being live coded to show the benefits of REPL driven development.",,100,2015,,,10:10am,,2206,5179,General Discussion,Developers,,,,10/24/2015 14:50,J251
4353, Why Agile Fails in Large Enterprises and What You Can Do About It,"Agile works great, when it works. It tends to be most successful in small companies, with small teams that can work completely independently of others. It tends to fail when more teams are involved, when there are dependencies between them. Even though we're ""doing Scrum"", it still just doesn't yield the promised benefits. When agile fails it can be disappointing and costly. People get blamed, agile gets blamed, the training gets blamed, and the organizational culture gets blamed. Yet companies keep trying. Many companies make multiple attempts to transition to agile because they've bought in to the underlying principles of agile and see it as a solution to their problem hitting dates, their long time to market, their slow return on investment, and their quality problems.<br/><br/>In this talk we'll examine 8 causes for Agile's failure in large enterprises, and why starting a transformation with culture or even practices isn't the solution. We'll examine why the ultimate solution begins with putting in place the certain organizational structures and planning a journey through predictability on our way to adaptability. Specifically, to begin we need a thoughtful mix of product or feature teams and component or service teams, as cross functional as practicable in each instance; agile structures above the team; and appropriate agile governance at the portfolio and program management layers. This creates an environment in which agile can begin to stick, can begin to deliver value, and creates a platform from which we can move on to increased agility.",,300,2015,,,11:20am,,2206,5180,General Discussion,Managers,,,,10/24/2015 14:50,J220A
4354,How API Gateways help to integrate with OAuth security models - Azure Cloud and On-premises cases.,"The OAuth 2.0 protocol and its OpenID Connect extension build an industry-standard framework that enables applications to outsource user authentication to a centralized service and to provide access to a remote resource on behalf of the user. Both protocols are getting a lot of popularity in the modern IT and Applications Integration landscape due to the benefits the protocols provide in the space of the universal identify management, authentication, authorization and single-sign-on (SSO). At the same time, both protocols may not be easy to implement, especially when applications that require integration with OAuth protocols are somewhat more complex, like BizTalk Server applications. API Gateways as generic ""brokers"" can significantly help to simplify support for OAuth security models by your custom applications and APIs.

4368,Introduction to Cross-Platform Mobile Development with Xamarin,"More and more users are demanding access to internet applications and services from their mobile devices, and increasingly they have come to expect nothing less than a true ""native"" experience. This can be difficult enough when supporting a single mobile platform, but nowadays it is common for most apps to require support for at least both iOS and Android, and on occasion Windows Phone as well. To avoid a need to maintain multiple product codebases, many companies are turning to cross-platform solutions. And while ""hybrid"" technologies such as Cordova / PhoneGap are helpful, many companies want the best user experience possible ? and that means real native apps. Xamarin is a different kind of cross-platform technology that allows us to share code between different devices and platforms ? while still offering a native user experience. In this presentation we will discuss what the Xamarin stack has to offer, and how you can get started using it.","This is an introductory level presentation, however prior experience with the Visual Studio platform would probably be beneficial.",100,2015,,,1:30pm,,2205,5191,Mobile Development,Developers,,,,10/24/2015 14:50,J201
